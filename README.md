# About Me :bust_in_silhouette:

My name is Chad. I'm currently studying Computer Science at UNC Charlotte as an undergraduate.

Outside of computer science, I'm trying other things such as photography and attempting to get into boxing.

# Projects :desktop_computer:

A sandwich shop that is capable of creating and tracking user orders by utilizing databases. Additional features include promotional codes and user feedback.

# Goals and Objectives :trophy:

I wish to learn more about software development as well as website development.

Creating more projects to garner more experience for the future is also something I'm looking forward to.
